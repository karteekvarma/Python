The **SQL_UI** file is a UI for connecting to Sakila DataBase and perform various CRUD operations. The UI can perform basic functions but 
it is not fool proof, as there are no warning/error messages set if the input given is wrong or how it should be given. UPDATE functionality 
has not been defined as it is mostly similar to deleted.
